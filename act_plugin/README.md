# Chompy FFXIV ACT Uploader Plugin

This ACT plugin uploads your parses and log data to provided parse server.

## Getting Started

1. In the ACT 'Plugins' tab, under 'Plugin Listing', click 'Browser' and locate 'Chompy_FFXIV_Uploader.cs.'
2. Click 'Add/Enable Plugin.'
3. The plugin should be added and initialized. Look for the string of text that says "Plugin version X started with session id XXXXX"
4. (TODO, WIP) Visit the Chompy FFXIV website with the session id from the last step.
